## Project Overview

AI Travel Planner helps users create detailed travel itineraries by combining live flight and hotel availability from APIs (Amadeus) with contextual, natural language trip planning generated by Google's Gemini LLM. Users enter preferences like destination, trip length, budget, interests, and the tool produces concise, practical day-by-day plans integrated with current pricing and options.

This tool supports both CLI and web interfaces via Streamlit.

## Features

- Accepts city names or IATA codes for origin and destination with automatic resolution using a local IATA codes mapping.
- Live flight search with real-time pricing and routing information.
- Live hotel lookup and sample offers in the destination city.
- AI-generated, concise, day-by-day itinerary tailored to user preferences, trip duration, and budget.
- Web UI built with Streamlit enabling interactive trip planning.
- CLI interface for quick planning sessions.
- Modular code architecture for easy maintenance and extension.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API for LLM-based itinerary generation
- Amadeus API for live flight and hotel data
- Streamlit for web interface
- Local JSON file for IATA city code mapping
- Requests or HTTP clients for API integration
- python-dotenv for environment variable management

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [<your-repo-url>](https://github.com/jack0sparrow1/AI_Travel_Planner.git)
cd AI_Travel_Planner 


2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows


3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
AMADUES_CLIENT_ID=your_amadeus_client_id_here
AMADUES_CLIENT_SECRET=your_amadeus_client_secret_here   

5. Ensure `iata_codes.json` file is present for city name to IATA code mapping.
